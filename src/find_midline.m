%
%function [dor, ven] = find_midline(s,T,S0,s_mid_in)
%
% This function takes gene expression patterns and determines where the
% ventral midline should be.  The genes are grouped into three categories:
% dorsal genes, ventral genes, and lateral genes.  This function uses these
% categories to help determine the ventral midline.  Problems arise when
% there are more than one gene in a given color channel.  In that case, we
% turn to the channels that have single genes to help us out.
%
% "s": DV coordinate, from -1 to 1. "T": gene expression intensities in
% each relevant color channel. "S0": presumptive locations of each peak of
% gene expression.  If an
%	element of S0 = 1 or 0, then that means there is a gene in that color
%	channel that is eithe fully dorsal (such as dpp) or fully ventral
%	(e.g., sna).
% "s_mid_in": the present estimate of the midline.  If this is NaN, then
%	the program will continue with its estimate of the midline. Otherwise,
%	the program will skip this entry so as not to perturb the
%	previously-found midline.
%
% Outputs:
%   ven - structs.pole for the ventral midline (consensus across channels)
%   dor - structs.pole for the dorsal midline (antipodal to ventral)
